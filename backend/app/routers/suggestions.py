Suggestions Router — Community Suggestions API Endpoints

Endpoints for corridor-level community participation:
- POST /corridors/{id}/suggestions - Submit a suggestion
- GET /corridors/{id}/suggestions - Get suggestions for a corridor
- POST /suggestions/{id}/upvote - Upvote a suggestion

DESIGN NOTES:
- No authentication required
- IP-based rate limiting for abuse prevention
- Suggestions are advisory and don't affect corridor ranking
