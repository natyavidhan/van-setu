Intervention Service — Corridor Classification & Green Intervention Suggestions

This service classifies corridors based on their dominant exposure type and
suggests appropriate green infrastructure interventions.

HOW INTERVENTION SUGGESTIONS ARE DERIVED:
=========================================

1. EXPOSURE SHARE CALCULATION:
   - Total = mean_heat + mean_aqi + mean_green_deficit
   - heat_share = mean_heat / Total
   - pollution_share = mean_aqi / Total
   - green_share = mean_green_deficit / Total

2. CLASSIFICATION (primary + secondary):
   - Primary type chosen by dominant share (heat / pollution / green_deficit / mixed)
   - Secondary type chosen by second-highest share (adds cross-cutting suggestions)

3. SEVERITY TIER (from priority score):
   - critical: priority >= 0.70
   - high:     priority >= 0.50
   - moderate: priority <  0.50

4. INTERVENTION SELECTION (deterministic but diverse):
   - 8–12 candidate interventions per type, split into severity tiers
   - 2–3 picked from primary type based on severity
   - 1 picked from secondary type (cross-cutting)
   - 1 picked from contextual add-ons based on specific metric values
   - A hash of the corridor's metric values rotates which candidates are
     selected, so corridors with the same type but different values get
     different suggestions.

This approach ensures:
- Deterministic, reproducible results — same corridor always gets same output
- High diversity — even corridors of the same type get varied suggestions
- No machine learning or complex models
- Clear rationale for each suggestion
- Actionable recommendations for urban planners
